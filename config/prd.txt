 üèóÔ∏è Architecture

  - Separate Docker Services: API Platform backend and Refine.dev frontend in separate containers, postgresql database service
  - GraphQL Integration: Full GraphQL support with API Platform and Refine.dev data provider
  - Microservices Pattern: Following 2025 best practices with proper separation of concerns

  üîß Backend (API Platform + Symfony)

  - Symfony with API Platform
  - GraphQL support enabled with GraphiQL interface

  üê≥ Docker Configuration

  - No version tags in compose.yaml
  - File sync for easy development (all folders auto-sync)
  - Separate services for frontend/backend/database
  - Optimized volumes for performance

study the best architecture for ports (i wish in dev, localhost access the frontend and localhodt/api access backend)

you must study hard and deep online about all latest versions of the techs, best practices and latest docs. implement all, pit services running and migrate darabase and test /localhost endpoint untill all is working.

after all research, prepare a detailed plan for this implementation, eithh all necessary orientations for a claude code agente implement. the plan must be a continuous topic tasks flow, each task very detailed, without "phases" or tinelines, just one detaiked step after the other.

once you elaborare the plan, come to me for discussion
