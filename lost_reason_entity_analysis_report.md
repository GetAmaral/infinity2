## 2. CRM Best Practices Research (2025)

### Key Insights from Industry Research

Based on comprehensive research of CRM lost reason analysis best practices in 2025, the following critical insights were identified:

#### A. Data Quality Challenges

**Critical Finding:** 60% of sellers are partially or completely wrong about why they lost a deal, with seller-reported reasons differing from buyer reasons 50-70% of the time.

**Implementation:** The LostReason entity addresses this by:
- Structured dropdown categories (not free text)
- Required notes option (`requiresNotes`) for critical reasons
- Internal tracking (`internal`) to separate seller analysis from customer-facing data
- Automation rules for follow-up buyer validation

#### B. Structured Data Collection

**Best Practice:** Free text doesn't enforce structure or consistency, preventing reliable analysis.

**Implementation:**
- `category` enum with 9 standardized categories: PRICING, COMPETITION, TIMING, BUDGET, FEATURES, FIT, RELATIONSHIP, PROCESS, OTHER
- `impact` enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
- `winBackPotential` enum: NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

#### C. Actionable Insights

**Best Practice:** Distinguish between actionable (pricing, features) vs non-actionable (market timing, budget cuts) reasons.

**Implementation:**
- `actionable` boolean flag
- `critical` flag for systemic issues requiring leadership review
- `automationRule` for automated workflows and notifications

#### D. Competitor Intelligence

**Best Practice:** Track which competitors are winning deals to identify market threats.

**Implementation:**
- `competitorName` field for competition-related losses
- Indexed for rapid competitor analysis queries

#### E. Win-Back Opportunities

**Best Practice:** Identify which lost deals should be nurtured for future opportunities.

**Implementation:**
- `winBackPotential` enum for systematic win-back prioritization
- Integration with Deal entity for longitudinal tracking

WHERE d.status = 'LOST'
  AND d.closed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months'
GROUP BY lr.actionable;
```

### 7.5 Critical Issues Alert

**Scenario:** Automated alerts for critical lost reasons

```sql

  AND d.status = 'LOST'
  AND d.closed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY lr.id, lr.name, lr.category, lr.impact
HAVING COUNT(d.id) >= 2  -- Alert if 2+ losses in 30 days
ORDER BY revenue_at_risk DESC;
```

## 11. Testing Recommendations

### 11.1 Unit Tests

```php
// tests/Entity/LostReasonTest.php
public function testDefaultValues(): void
{
    $lostReason = new LostReason();
    $this->assertTrue($lostReason->getActive());
    $this->assertFalse($lostReason->getDefault());
    $this->assertEquals(0, $lostReason->getSortOrder());
    $this->assertFalse($lostReason->getRequiresNotes());
}

public function testCategoryEnum(): void
{
    $lostReason = new LostReason();
    $lostReason->setCategory('PRICING');
    $this->assertEquals('PRICING', $lostReason->getCategory());
}
```

### 11.2 Integration Tests

```php
// tests/Repository/LostReasonRepositoryTest.php
public function testFindActiveByCategoryQuery(): void
{
    $reasons = $this->lostReasonRepository->findActiveByCategory('PRICING');
    $this->assertGreaterThan(0, count($reasons));

    foreach ($reasons as $reason) {
        $this->assertTrue($reason->getActive());
        $this->assertEquals('PRICING', $reason->getCategory());
    }
}
```

### 11.3 API Tests

```php
// tests/Api/LostReasonApiTest.php
public function testGetCollection(): void
{
    $response = static::createClient()->request('GET', '/api/lost_reasons');
    $this->assertResponseIsSuccessful();
    $this->assertJsonContains(['@type' => 'hydra:Collection']);
}

public function testPostLostReason(): void
{
    $response = static::createClient()->request('POST', '/api/lost_reasons', [
        'json' => [

    ]);
    $this->assertResponseStatusCodeSame(201);
}
```

## 12. Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Query Performance (PostgreSQL 18)

| Query Type | Expected Time | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| Single lookup by ID | < 1ms | UUID primary key |
| Filter by category (indexed) | < 5ms | Single index scan |
| Filter by active status (indexed) | < 5ms | Boolean index |
| Join with deals (1000 deals) | < 50ms | Foreign key indexed |
| Aggregate by category | < 100ms | Index + group by |
| Complex analytics query | < 500ms | Multiple joins + aggregates |

### Optimization Tips

1. **Use Prepared Statements**: For repeated queries
2. **Limit Result Sets**: Add LIMIT clauses to large queries
3. **Analyze Query Plans**: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for slow queries
4. **Monitor Index Usage**: Check pg_stat_user_indexes
5. **Consider Materialized Views**: For complex analytics queries run frequently

## 13. Comparison: Before vs After

| Aspect | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Properties | 3 | 16 | +433% |
| API Documentation | 0% complete | 100% complete | Complete |
| Indexed Properties | 0 | 9 | Performance optimized |
| Enum Properties | 0 | 3 | Structured data |
| Boolean Properties | 0 | 6 | Rich metadata |
| CRM Best Practices | None | Full implementation | Enterprise-grade |
| Analytics Capabilities | Basic | Advanced | Strategic insights |
| Automation Support | None | Full (automationRule) | Workflow integration |

---

## 14. Security Considerations

### API Security

- `deals` relationship is **read-only** via API (api_writable = false)
- Prevents external systems from modifying deal associations
- All write operations must go through Deal entity

### Data Privacy

- `internal` flag allows sensitive tracking without customer exposure
- Automation rules should validate notification recipients
- Consider GDPR/privacy implications of competitor names

### Validation Rules

Recommended validation constraints:

```php
#[Assert\NotBlank]
#[Assert\Length(max: 100)]
private string $name;

#[Assert\Choice(choices: ['PRICING', 'COMPETITION', 'TIMING', 'BUDGET', 'FEATURES', 'FIT', 'RELATIONSHIP', 'PROCESS', 'OTHER'])]
#[Assert\NotBlank]
private string $category;

#[Assert\Regex(pattern: '/^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$/')]
private ?string $color = null;

#[Assert\Range(min: 0, max: 9999)]
private int $sortOrder = 0;
```

---

## 15. Future Enhancements (Recommendations)

### Phase 2 Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Predict win-back success based on historical data
   - Auto-classify reasons using NLP on deal notes
   - Recommend best actions based on reason patterns

2. **Enhanced Analytics**
   - Add `firstOccurred` and `lastOccurred` timestamps
   - Track `totalDealsLost` and `totalRevenueLost` as computed properties
   - Add `trendDirection` (INCREASING, STABLE, DECREASING)

3. **Advanced Automation**
   - Integration with email marketing platforms
   - Webhook support for external systems
   - Conditional logic builder (no-code)

4. **Competitive Intelligence**
   - Link to Competitor entity (when created)
   - Competitive battle card recommendations
   - Win-loss ratio by competitor

5. **Sales Coaching**
   - Link to training resources per reason
   - Track which reps struggle with specific reasons
   - Auto-suggest best practices

```sql
-- Query 1: Most common lost reasons (last 6 months)
SELECT
    lr.name,
    lr.category,
    COUNT(d.id) as occurrences,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(d.id) / SUM(COUNT(d.id)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM lost_reason lr
LEFT JOIN deal d ON d.lost_reason_id = lr.id
    AND d.status = 'LOST'
    AND d.closed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months'
GROUP BY lr.id, lr.name, lr.category
ORDER BY occurrences DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Query 2: Critical issues requiring attention
SELECT
    lr.name,
    lr.category,
    lr.impact,
    COUNT(d.id) as recent_occurrences,
    SUM(d.value) as revenue_impact,
    MAX(d.closed_at) as most_recent
FROM lost_reason lr
JOIN deal d ON d.lost_reason_id = lr.id
WHERE lr.critical = true
  AND d.status = 'LOST'
  AND d.closed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY lr.id, lr.name, lr.category, lr.impact
ORDER BY revenue_impact DESC;

-- Query 3: Win-back pipeline
SELECT
    d.name as deal_name,
    d.value,
    c.name as company_name,
    lr.name as lost_reason,
    lr.winBackPotential,
