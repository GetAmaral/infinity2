## Detailed Analysis by Entity

### 1. StepConnection

**File:** `/home/user/inf/app/src/Entity/StepConnection.php`
**Table:** `step_connection`
**Extends:** `EntityBase` (has created_by, updated_by, created_at, updated_at)

#### Current State
- Represents visual workflow connections between StepOutput and StepInput
- OneToOne relationship with StepOutput (source)
- ManyToOne relationship with StepInput (target)
- Unique constraint: `unique_connection (source_output_id, target_input_id)`
- Existing indexes: created_by, updated_by, source_output, target_input

#### Critical Issues
1. **Missing organization_id** - No multi-tenant isolation
2. **Inefficient organization queries** - Must join through output → step → treeflow
3. **No organization-based indexes** - Slow filtered queries

#### Optimizations Applied
```sql
✅ ADD organization_id UUID NOT NULL
✅ FK constraint to organization (CASCADE)
✅ INDEX idx_step_connection_org_created (organization_id, created_at DESC)
✅ INDEX idx_step_connection_org_output (organization_id, source_output_id)
✅ Populated from source output's step's treeflow
```

#### Performance Impact
- **Before:** 3 JOINs to filter by organization
- **After:** Direct organization_id filter with index
- **Estimated improvement:** 80-95% faster for organization queries

---

### 2. StepInput

**File:** `/home/user/inf/app/src/Entity/StepInput.php`
**Table:** `step_input`
**Extends:** `EntityBase`

#### Current State
- Defines how a Step can be entered
- ManyToOne relationship with Step
- OneToMany relationship with StepConnection
- Enum type: InputType (ANY, FULLY_COMPLETED, FAILED)
- Has deprecated `source_step_id` column (migration line 112-116)
- Fields: name, slug (nullable), prompt, type

#### Critical Issues
1. **Missing organization_id** - No multi-tenant isolation
2. **Slug not unique within step** - Potential data integrity issues
3. **No type-based indexes** - Slow filtering by InputType
4. **Deprecated column exists** - `source_step_id` should be removed

#### Optimizations Applied
```sql
✅ ADD organization_id UUID NOT NULL
✅ FK constraint to organization (CASCADE)
✅ INDEX idx_step_input_org_step (organization_id, step_id)
✅ INDEX idx_step_input_org_type (organization_id, type)
✅ UNIQUE INDEX uniq_step_input_step_slug (step_id, slug) WHERE slug IS NOT NULL
✅ Populated from step's treeflow
```

#### Recommendations for Future
```sql
-- Remove deprecated column (after verifying no usage)
ALTER TABLE step_input DROP COLUMN source_step_id;
```

---

### 3. StepOutput

**File:** `/home/user/inf/app/src/Entity/StepOutput.php`
**Table:** `step_output`
**Extends:** `EntityBase`

#### Current State
- Defines possible exits from a Step
- ManyToOne relationship with Step
- OneToOne relationship with StepConnection (optional)
- Has deprecated `destination_step_id` column (migration line 124-128)
- Fields: name, slug (nullable), description, conditional

#### Critical Issues
1. **Missing organization_id** - No multi-tenant isolation
2. **Slug not unique within step** - Potential data integrity issues
3. **No conditional-specific index** - Slow queries for outputs with conditions
4. **Deprecated column exists** - `destination_step_id` should be removed

#### Optimizations Applied
```sql
✅ ADD organization_id UUID NOT NULL
✅ FK constraint to organization (CASCADE)
✅ INDEX idx_step_output_org_step (organization_id, step_id)
✅ INDEX idx_step_output_conditional (step_id) WHERE conditional IS NOT NULL
✅ UNIQUE INDEX uniq_step_output_step_slug (step_id, slug) WHERE slug IS NOT NULL
✅ Populated from step's treeflow
```

#### Recommendations for Future
```sql
-- Remove deprecated column (after verifying no usage)
ALTER TABLE step_output DROP COLUMN destination_step_id;
```

### 4. StepQuestion

**File:** `/home/user/inf/app/src/Entity/StepQuestion.php`
**Table:** `step_question` (renamed from `question` in migration Version20251005030046)
**Extends:** `EntityBase`

#### Current State
- Questions for AI to answer within a Step
- ManyToOne relationship with Step
- Fields: name, slug (NOT NULL), prompt, objective, importance (nullable, 1-10)
- Has view_order for UI display
- Has few_shot_positive and few_shot_negative JSON arrays

#### Migration History
- Originally created as `question` table (Version20251004051818, line 87)
- Renamed to `step_question` (Version20251005030046, line 23)
- Importance made nullable (Version20251006081735, line 23)
- Added JSONB columns (Version20251006010214, line 25-26)

#### Critical Issues
1. **Missing organization_id** - No multi-tenant isolation
2. **Slug not unique constraint** - Should be unique within step
3. **No validation on importance** - Can exceed 1-10 range in DB
4. **No view_order index** - Slow ordered queries
5. **No importance filtering index** - Slow priority queries

#### Optimizations Applied
```sql
✅ ADD organization_id UUID NOT NULL
✅ FK constraint to organization (CASCADE)
✅ INDEX idx_step_question_org_step (organization_id, step_id)
✅ INDEX idx_step_question_step_order (step_id, view_order)
✅ INDEX idx_step_question_importance (step_id, importance) WHERE importance IS NOT NULL
✅ UNIQUE INDEX uniq_step_question_step_slug (step_id, slug)
✅ CHECK CONSTRAINT chk_step_question_importance (importance BETWEEN 1 AND 10)
✅ Populated from step's treeflow
```

#### Data Integrity Notes
- Entity has `@Assert\Range(min: 1, max: 10)` validation
- Database now enforces same constraint at DB level
- Slug is NOT NULL in entity but was nullable in original schema

---

### 5. AuditLog

**File:** `/home/user/inf/app/src/Entity/AuditLog.php`
**Table:** `audit_log`
**Does NOT extend:** EntityBase (standalone entity)

#### Current State
- Complete historical record of all entity changes
- Tracks: action, entity_class, entity_id, user, changes, metadata
- Has checksum field for tamper detection (SHA-256)
- Has comprehensive indexes already:
  - `idx_audit_entity (entity_class, entity_id)`
  - `idx_audit_user (user_id, created_at)`
  - `idx_audit_action (action, created_at)`
  - `idx_audit_created (created_at)`

#### Migration History
- Created in Version20251004051818 (line 23-32)
- Already has excellent index coverage

#### Current Issues
1. **Missing organization context** - Can't efficiently query by organization
2. **No composite org indexes** - Slow organization-based audit reports
3. **No checksum index** - Inefficient integrity verification queries
4. **No action+org index** - Slow compliance reporting

#### Optimizations Applied
```sql
✅ ADD organization_id UUID (nullable - for system-wide audit logs)
✅ FK constraint to organization (SET NULL on delete)
✅ INDEX idx_audit_org_created (organization_id, created_at DESC)
✅ INDEX idx_audit_org_entity (organization_id, entity_class, entity_id)
✅ INDEX idx_audit_checksum (id) WHERE checksum IS NOT NULL
✅ INDEX idx_audit_action_org (action, organization_id, created_at DESC)
✅ Smart population based on entity_class
```

#### Population Strategy
The organization_id is populated using a CASE statement that extracts the organization from the audited entity:
```sql
UPDATE audit_log al
SET organization_id = (
    CASE
        WHEN al.entity_class = 'App\Entity\TreeFlow' THEN
            (SELECT organization_id FROM tree_flow WHERE id = al.entity_id)
        WHEN al.entity_class = 'App\Entity\Course' THEN
            (SELECT organization_id FROM course WHERE id = al.entity_id)
        -- etc...
    END
);
```

#### Use Cases Enabled
- **Organization-wide audit reports** - All changes within an organization
- **Compliance queries** - GDPR, SOC2 audit trails by organization
- **Tamper detection** - Fast checksum verification
- **User activity tracking** - Actions by user within organization
- **Entity history** - Complete change log for any entity by organization

---

### 6. CourseModule

**File:** `/home/user/inf/app/src/Entity/CourseModule.php`
**Table:** `course_module`
**Extends:** `EntityBase`

#### Current State
- Part of course/module/lecture hierarchy
- ManyToOne relationship with Course
- OneToMany relationship with CourseLecture
- Fields: name, description, active, release_date, view_order, total_length_seconds
- Has business logic: `calculateTotalLengthSeconds()`, `getTotalLengthFormatted()`

#### Migration History
- Created in Version20251004051818 (line 57-67)
- Has indexes: created_by, updated_by, course_id

#### Critical Issues
1. **Missing organization_id** - Must join through course for organization queries
2. **No organization indexes** - Slow organization-wide module queries
3. **No validation constraints** - view_order and total_length_seconds can be negative
4. **No release date index** - Slow date-based filtering
5. **No view_order index** - Slow ordered queries

#### Optimizations Applied
```sql
✅ ADD organization_id UUID NOT NULL (denormalized from course)
✅ FK constraint to organization (CASCADE)
✅ INDEX idx_course_module_org_active (organization_id, active, release_date)
✅ INDEX idx_course_module_course_order (course_id, view_order)
✅ INDEX idx_course_module_release (course_id, release_date) WHERE active AND release_date IS NOT NULL
✅ CHECK CONSTRAINT chk_course_module_view_order (view_order >= 0)
✅ CHECK CONSTRAINT chk_course_module_length (total_length_seconds >= 0)
✅ Populated from course
```

#### Performance Impact
- **Before:** JOIN to course to filter by organization
- **After:** Direct organization_id filter with composite index
- **Use case:** "Show all active modules across all courses in organization"
- **Estimated improvement:** 70-90% faster

#### Business Logic Preserved
The entity already has good business logic:
- `calculateTotalLengthSeconds()` - Aggregates lecture lengths
- `getTotalLengthFormatted()` - Human-readable duration (e.g., "02:45")
- View order management for UI display
- Active/release date for content management

## Cross-Entity Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

All step-related entities now have consistent organization isolation:

```
TreeFlow (organization_id)
    ├── Step
    │   ├── StepInput (organization_id) ✅ NEW
    │   │   └── StepConnection (organization_id) ✅ NEW
    │   ├── StepOutput (organization_id) ✅ NEW
    │   │   └── StepConnection (organization_id) ✅ NEW
    │   └── StepQuestion (organization_id) ✅ NEW
```

### Data Integrity Hierarchy

```
Organization
    ├── TreeFlow
    │   └── Step
    │       ├── StepInput (unique slug within step)
    │       ├── StepOutput (unique slug within step)
    │       ├── StepQuestion (unique slug within step)
    │       └── StepConnection (unique per output→input pair)
    │
    ├── Course
    │   └── CourseModule (organization_id denormalized)
    │       └── CourseLecture
    │
    └── AuditLog (organization_id optional, for system-wide logs)
```

## Index Strategy Summary

### Organization-Based Indexes (Multi-Tenant)
```sql
-- Pattern: (organization_id, primary_key, sort_field)
idx_step_connection_org_created   (organization_id, created_at DESC)
idx_step_input_org_step           (organization_id, step_id)
idx_step_output_org_step          (organization_id, step_id)
idx_step_question_org_step        (organization_id, step_id)
idx_course_module_org_active      (organization_id, active, release_date)
idx_audit_org_created             (organization_id, created_at DESC)
```

### Uniqueness Indexes (Data Integrity)
```sql
-- Pattern: (parent_id, slug) WHERE slug IS NOT NULL
uniq_step_input_step_slug         (step_id, slug)
uniq_step_output_step_slug        (step_id, slug)
uniq_step_question_step_slug      (step_id, slug)
```

### Functional Indexes (Query Optimization)
```sql
-- Conditional outputs only
idx_step_output_conditional       (step_id) WHERE conditional IS NOT NULL

-- Active modules with release dates
idx_course_module_release         (course_id, release_date) WHERE active AND release_date IS NOT NULL

-- Questions with importance
idx_step_question_importance      (step_id, importance) WHERE importance IS NOT NULL

-- Audit logs with checksums
idx_audit_checksum                (id) WHERE checksum IS NOT NULL
```

### Composite Indexes (Complex Queries)
```sql
-- Organization + secondary filters
idx_step_input_org_type           (organization_id, type)
idx_step_connection_org_output    (organization_id, source_output_id)
idx_audit_org_entity              (organization_id, entity_class, entity_id)
idx_audit_action_org              (action, organization_id, created_at DESC)

-- Parent + ordering
idx_step_question_step_order      (step_id, view_order)
idx_course_module_course_order    (course_id, view_order)
```

---

## Constraint Strategy Summary

### Check Constraints (Data Validation)
```sql
chk_step_question_importance      (importance IS NULL OR importance BETWEEN 1 AND 10)
chk_course_module_view_order      (view_order >= 0)
chk_course_module_length          (total_length_seconds >= 0)
```

### Foreign Key Constraints
```sql
-- Multi-tenant isolation (CASCADE on delete)
FK_step_connection_organization   ON DELETE CASCADE
FK_step_input_organization        ON DELETE CASCADE
FK_step_output_organization       ON DELETE CASCADE
FK_step_question_organization     ON DELETE CASCADE
FK_course_module_organization     ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Audit logs (SET NULL - preserve audit trail)
FK_audit_log_organization         ON DELETE SET NULL
```

---

## Migration Safety

### Data Population Verification

The SQL includes verification blocks for each entity:

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    null_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO null_count
    FROM step_connection
    WHERE organization_id IS NULL;

    IF null_count > 0 THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Found % records with NULL organization_id', null_count;
    END IF;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Verification passed: All records populated';
END $$;
```

### Rollback Script Included

Complete rollback script at bottom of SQL file for emergency use.

## Query Pattern Examples

### Before Optimization
```sql
-- Get all step inputs for an organization (3 JOINs)
SELECT si.*
FROM step_input si
JOIN step s ON si.step_id = s.id
JOIN tree_flow tf ON s.tree_flow_id = tf.id
WHERE tf.organization_id = :org_id;
```

### After Optimization
```sql
-- Get all step inputs for an organization (direct filter + index)
SELECT si.*
FROM step_input si
WHERE si.organization_id = :org_id;

-- Uses: idx_step_input_org_step
```

---

### Before Optimization
```sql
-- Get audit logs for organization entities (very slow)
SELECT al.*
FROM audit_log al
WHERE (
    (al.entity_class = 'App\Entity\TreeFlow' AND al.entity_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM tree_flow WHERE organization_id = :org_id
    ))
    OR (al.entity_class = 'App\Entity\Course' AND al.entity_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM course WHERE organization_id = :org_id
    ))
    -- ... many more OR conditions
)
ORDER BY al.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### After Optimization
```sql
-- Get audit logs for organization (direct filter + index)
SELECT al.*
FROM audit_log al
WHERE al.organization_id = :org_id
ORDER BY al.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- Uses: idx_audit_org_created
```

---

## Compliance & Security Benefits

### GDPR Data Subject Requests
```sql
-- Before: Complex multi-table query
-- After: Single audit log query by organization + user
SELECT al.*
FROM audit_log al
WHERE al.organization_id = :org_id
  AND al.user_id = :user_id
ORDER BY al.created_at DESC;
```

### SOC2 Audit Trails
```sql
-- Before: Slow action filtering across all data
-- After: Fast organization + action filtering
SELECT al.*
FROM audit_log al
WHERE al.organization_id = :org_id
  AND al.action = 'entity_deleted'
  AND al.created_at >= :start_date
ORDER BY al.created_at DESC;

-- Uses: idx_audit_action_org
```

### Data Integrity Verification
```sql
-- Verify audit log tampering
SELECT COUNT(*) as tampered_records
FROM audit_log
WHERE checksum IS NOT NULL
  AND organization_id = :org_id;

-- Uses: idx_audit_checksum
```

---

## Deprecated Columns Identified

### StepInput.source_step_id
- **Status:** Deprecated (replaced by StepConnection)
- **Migration:** Version20251004051818, line 116
- **Recommendation:** Remove after verifying no usage

### StepOutput.destination_step_id
- **Status:** Deprecated (replaced by StepConnection)
- **Migration:** Version20251004051818, line 128
- **Recommendation:** Remove after verifying no usage

### Cleanup SQL (for future use)
```sql
-- Verify no usage first!
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM step_input WHERE source_step_id IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM step_output WHERE destination_step_id IS NOT NULL;

-- If both return 0, safe to remove:
ALTER TABLE step_input DROP COLUMN source_step_id;
ALTER TABLE step_output DROP COLUMN destination_step_id;
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Pre-Execution
- [ ] Backup database
- [ ] Verify Docker containers running
- [ ] Check current table structures match expectations
- [ ] Review entity relationships in code

### Execution
- [ ] Run SQL in transaction (already wrapped in BEGIN/COMMIT)
- [ ] Monitor verification output messages
- [ ] Check for any EXCEPTIONS or WARNINGS
- [ ] Verify all NOTICE messages show success

### Post-Execution
- [ ] Run ANALYZE on all modified tables
- [ ] Check query performance on sample queries
- [ ] Verify application still functions correctly
- [ ] Monitor slow query logs for improvements

### Testing Queries
```sql
-- Verify indexes created
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename IN (
    'step_connection', 'step_input', 'step_output',
    'step_question', 'audit_log', 'course_module'
)
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- Verify constraints created
SELECT conname, contype, conrelid::regclass
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid::regclass::text IN (
    'step_connection', 'step_input', 'step_output',
    'step_question', 'audit_log', 'course_module'
)
ORDER BY conrelid, conname;

-- Check organization_id population
SELECT
    'step_connection' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(organization_id) as with_org
FROM step_connection
UNION ALL
SELECT 'step_input', COUNT(*), COUNT(organization_id) FROM step_input
UNION ALL
SELECT 'step_output', COUNT(*), COUNT(organization_id) FROM step_output
UNION ALL
SELECT 'step_question', COUNT(*), COUNT(organization_id) FROM step_question
UNION ALL
SELECT 'audit_log', COUNT(*), COUNT(organization_id) FROM audit_log
UNION ALL
SELECT 'course_module', COUNT(*), COUNT(organization_id) FROM course_module;
```

---

## Future Recommendations

### 1. Remove Deprecated Columns
After verifying zero usage:
- `step_input.source_step_id`
- `step_output.destination_step_id`

### 2. Consider Adding Entities
The following entities were requested but don't exist. Consider if they should be created:
- **Notification** - User notifications system
- **NotificationType** - Notification templates/types
- **Reminder** - Scheduled reminders
- **Flag** - Feature flags or entity flags

### 3. Audit Log Enhancements
```sql
-- Add retention policy support
ALTER TABLE audit_log ADD COLUMN retention_date DATE;
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_retention ON audit_log(retention_date)
    WHERE retention_date IS NOT NULL;

-- Add partition support for old audit logs
-- (PostgreSQL declarative partitioning by created_at)
```

### 4. StepQuestion Importance
Consider if importance should be NOT NULL with default value 1:
```sql
ALTER TABLE step_question ALTER COLUMN importance SET DEFAULT 1;
UPDATE step_question SET importance = 1 WHERE importance IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE step_question ALTER COLUMN importance SET NOT NULL;
```

### 5. CourseModule Calculated Field
Consider adding trigger to auto-update total_length_seconds:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_module_length()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE course_module
    SET total_length_seconds = (
        SELECT COALESCE(SUM(length_seconds), 0)
        FROM course_lecture
        WHERE course_module_id = NEW.course_module_id
    )
    WHERE id = NEW.course_module_id;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_update_module_length
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON course_lecture
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_module_length();
```
