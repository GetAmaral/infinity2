## 🔗 ALL BIDIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS ADDED

### **Organization Inverse Relationships** (21 added)

ALL new entities now have inverse OneToMany relationships in Organization:

```csv
Organization,leads → Lead.organization
Organization,quotes → Quote.organization
Organization,cases → Case.organization
Organization,activities → Activity.organization
Organization,emails → Email.organization
Organization,callLogs → CallLog.organization
Organization,notes → Note.organization
Organization,territories → Territory.organization
Organization,winReasons → WinReason.organization
Organization,dashboards → Dashboard.organization
Organization,reports → Report.organization
Organization,predictions → Prediction.organization
Organization,aiInsights → AIInsight.organization
Organization,knowledgeArticles → KnowledgeArticle.organization
Organization,slas → SLA.organization
Organization,entitlements → Entitlement.organization
Organization,emailIntegrations → EmailIntegration.organization
Organization,calendarIntegrations → CalendarIntegration.organization
Organization,externalEvents → ExternalEvent.organization
Organization,webhookSubscriptions → WebhookSubscription.organization
Organization,customerJourneys → CustomerJourney.organization
```

**Fetch Strategies Applied**:
- Large collections (leads, quotes, cases, activities, emails, callLogs, notes, predictions, aiInsights, externalEvents) → `EXTRA_LAZY`
- Small collections (territories, winReasons, dashboards, reports, knowledgeArticles, slas, entitlements, integrations, webhooks, journeys) → `LAZY`

### **User Inverse Relationships** (8 added)

```csv
User,assignedLeads → Lead.assignedTo

User,assignedActivities → Activity.assignedTo
User,authoredNotes → Note.author
User,authoredCaseComments → CaseComment.author
User,ownedDashboards → Dashboard.owner
User,managedTerritories → Territory.manager
```

All with `EXTRA_LAZY` fetch for large collections, `LAZY` for small.

---

### **Company Inverse Relationships** (2 added)

```csv
Company,quotes → Quote.account
Company,cases → Case.account
```

Both with `EXTRA_LAZY` fetch.

---

### **Contact Inverse Relationships** (4 added)

```csv
Contact,convertedLeads → Lead.convertedToContact
Contact,quotes → Quote.contact
Contact,cases → Case.contact
Contact,callLogs → CallLog.contact

## 📊 PERFORMANCE IMPACT (PROJECTED)

Based on CRM_DATABASE_IMPROVEMENTS.md projections:

| Query | Before | After | Improvement |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Organization load with collections | 5s (loads ALL) | 50ms (lazy loaded) | **100x** |
| Contact list | 2.3s | 35ms | **67x** |
| Deal pipeline | 3.5s | 46ms | **75x** |

## 🚀 READY FOR GENERATION

### Next Steps:

1. **Test Generator** (CRITICAL - test first!)
   ```bash
   cd /home/user/inf/app
   php bin/console app:generate-from-csv --dry-run
   ```

2. **Review Output** - Check for any validation errors

3. **Generate Entities**
   ```bash
   php bin/console app:generate-from-csv
   ```

4. **Create Migration**
   ```bash
   php bin/console make:migration
   # REVIEW the migration file carefully!
   ```

5. **Test Migration** (Development first!)
   ```bash
   php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction --env=dev
   php bin/phpunit tests/Entity/
   ```
