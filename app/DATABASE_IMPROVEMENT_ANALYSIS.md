## 🔴 CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS (High Priority)

### 1. Missing Audit Trail Fields

**Issue:** Entities lack comprehensive audit fields for tracking changes and soft deletes.

**Required Fields for ALL Entities:**
```php
// Audit Trail
#[ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity: User::class)]
protected ?User $createdBy = null;

#[ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity: User::class)]
protected ?User $updatedBy = null;

// Soft Delete
#[ORM\Column(type: 'datetime_immutable', nullable: true)]
protected ?\DateTimeImmutable $deletedAt = null;

#[ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity: User::class)]
protected ?User $deletedBy = null;
```

**Entities Missing Audit Fields (67):**
```
Organization, User, Role, City, Country
ProfileTemplate, Profile, SocialMediaType, SocialMedia, Contact
Company, Flag, Talk, TalkType, TalkTypeTemplate
TalkMessage, Attachment, AgentType, Agent, Deal
DealStage, DealCategory, DealType, Pipeline, PipelineTemplate
PipelineStage, PipelineStageTemplate, Task, TaskTemplate, TaskType
LeadSource, Product, ProductBatch, ProductCategory, ProductLine
Brand, TaxCategory, Competitor, LostReason, Tag
BillingFrequency, Campaign, Calendar, CalendarType, CalendarExternalLink
Event, EventAttendee, Reminder, Notification, NotificationType
NotificationTypeTemplate, EventCategory, EventResource, EventResourceType, EventResourceBooking
MeetingData, WorkingHour, Holiday, HolidayTemplate, TimeZone
CommunicationMethod, Course, CourseModule, CourseLecture, StudentCourse
StudentLecture, Module
```

**Action:** Add `createdBy`, `updatedBy`, `deletedAt`, `deletedBy` to all entities.

### 2. Missing Database Indexes (Performance Critical)

**Issue:** No indexes defined on foreign keys, search fields, or filter fields.

**Index Recommendations by Entity:**

#### Organization
```php
#[ORM\Entity]
#[ORM\Table(name: 'organization')]

### 5. Orphan Removal Configuration

**Issue:** OneToMany relationships should use orphanRemoval for owned entities.

**Pattern:**
```php
// Parent owns children - enable orphan removal
#[ORM\OneToMany(mappedBy: 'parent', targetEntity: Child::class, 
    cascade: ['persist', 'remove'], orphanRemoval: true)]
protected Collection $children;
```

#### Organization
Properties: `lectures`

#### Talk
Properties: `messages`

#### TalkMessage
Properties: `attachments`

#### Pipeline
Properties: `stages`

#### PipelineTemplate
Properties: `stages`

#### Product
Properties: `attachments`

#### Event
Properties: `attendees`, `attachments`

#### Course
Properties: `lectures`

#### CourseModule
Properties: `lectures`

## 🔒 SECURITY & ACCESS CONTROL IMPROVEMENTS

### 6. Granular Role-Based Access Control

**Current Issue:** All entities use same security: `is_granted('ROLE_USER')`

**Recommended Roles Structure:**
```yaml
# System Entities - Admin only
Role, City, Country, TimeZone, CommunicationMethod:
  security: "is_granted('ROLE_ADMIN')"

# Configuration Entities - Manager access
ProfileTemplate, TalkTypeTemplate, AgentType, CalendarType:
  security: "is_granted('ROLE_MANAGER')"

# Business Entities - User access with voter
Contact, Company, Deal, Task:
  security: "is_granted('VIEW', object)"

# Personal Data - Owner only
User profile, preferences:
  security: "is_granted('EDIT', object) or object.id == user.id"
```

**Security Changes Needed (20 entities):**

- **Organization**
  - Current: `is_granted('ROLE_USER')`
  - Suggested: `is_granted('ROLE_ADMIN')`
  - Reason: Based on menu group: System

- **User**
  - Current: `is_granted('ROLE_USER')`
  - Suggested: `is_granted('VIEW', object) or object == user`
  - Reason: Based on menu group: Configuration

- **Role**
  - Current: `is_granted('ROLE_USER')`
  - Suggested: `is_granted('ROLE_ADMIN')`
  - Reason: Based on menu group: System

- **City**
  - Current: `is_granted('ROLE_USER')`
  - Suggested: `is_granted('ROLE_ADMIN')`
  - Reason: Based on menu group: System

- **Country**

  - Suggested: `is_granted('VIEW', object) or object == user`
  - Reason: Based on menu group: Configuration

  - Suggested: `is_granted('ROLE_ADMIN')`
  - Reason: Based on menu group: System

  - Reason: Based on menu group: System

- **Module**
  - Current: `is_granted('ROLE_USER')`
  - Suggested: `is_granted('ROLE_ADMIN')`
  - Reason: Based on menu group: System

### 7. Field-Level Security (Sensitive Data)

**Issue:** Sensitive fields exposed in API without proper groups.

**Sensitive Fields Requiring Protection:**

#### User
```php
// Remove from API or restrict to admin
#[Groups(['admin:read'])] // NOT in regular user:read
protected $password;

// Remove from API or restrict to admin
#[Groups(['admin:read'])] // NOT in regular user:read
protected $emailVerifiedAt;

// Remove from API or restrict to admin
#[Groups(['admin:read'])] // NOT in regular user:read
protected $failedLoginAttempts;

// Remove from API or restrict to admin
#[Groups(['admin:read'])] // NOT in regular user:read
protected $lockedOut;

// Remove from API or restrict to admin
#[Groups(['admin:read'])] // NOT in regular user:read
protected $lastPasswordChange;

```

#### Organization
```php
// Remove from API or restrict to admin
#[Groups(['admin:read'])] // NOT in regular user:read
protected $securityConfig;

// Remove from API or restrict to admin
#[Groups(['admin:read'])] // NOT in regular user:read
protected $integrationConfig;

// Remove from API or restrict to admin
#[Groups(['admin:read'])] // NOT in regular user:read
protected $businessSettings;

```

## ✅ DATA VALIDATION IMPROVEMENTS

### 8. Enhanced Validation Rules

**Issue:** Minimal validation on important fields.

**Validation Improvements:**

---

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### 9. Fetch Strategies

**Issue:** All relationships use LAZY fetch (default).

**Recommendations:**

```php
// EAGER - Small, frequently accessed collections
#[ORM\OneToMany(fetch: 'EAGER')]  // e.g., Course->modules (max 10-20)

// EXTRA_LAZY - Large collections
#[ORM\OneToMany(fetch: 'EXTRA_LAZY')]  // e.g., Organization->contacts (1000s)

// LAZY - Default (most cases)
#[ORM\ManyToOne(fetch: 'LAZY')]
```

**Suggested EXTRA_LAZY Collections:**
```
Organization: contacts, companies, deals, tasks, events (large collections)
User: managedContacts, managedDeals, tasks (large collections)
Contact: talks, tasks, deals (large collections)
```

### 10. Pagination Optimization

**Current:** All entities use 30 items per page.

**Recommendation:**
```yaml
# Large datasets - reduce page size
Contact, Company, Deal, Event: 20 items

# Medium datasets - default
Task, Product, Campaign: 30 items

# Small datasets - increase
City, Country, Role, TaxCategory: 50 items
```

---

## 🆕 MISSING CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY

### 11. Missing Entities

**Suggested Additional Entities:**

```yaml
# Audit System
AuditLog:
  properties: [entityType, entityId, action, oldValues, newValues, user, ipAddress, userAgent, createdAt]

# File Management
Document:
  properties: [name, path, mimeType, size, organization, uploadedBy, folder]

# Notification System (enhanced)
NotificationQueue:
  properties: [recipient, channel, status, scheduledAt, sentAt, failureReason]

# Team Management
Team:
  properties: [name, organization, manager, members]

# Email Tracking
Email:
  properties: [subject, body, from, to, status, sentAt, openedAt, clickedAt]
```

---

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1: Critical (Week 1) ⚠️
1. Add audit fields (createdBy, updatedBy, deletedAt) to all entities
2. Add indexes on all foreign keys (ManyToOne relationships)
3. Add composite indexes for organization_id + created_at
4. Fix security expressions for System/Admin entities

### Phase 2: High Priority (Week 2)
5. Configure cascade operations on OneToMany relationships
6. Enable orphanRemoval for owned relationships
7. Add indexes on searchable/filterable fields
8. Enhance field validation rules

### Phase 3: Performance (Week 3)
9. Optimize fetch strategies (EXTRA_LAZY for large collections)
10. Adjust pagination sizes per entity
11. Add field-level security for sensitive data

### Phase 4: Enhancement (Week 4)
12. Implement missing entities (AuditLog, Document, Team)
13. Add more granular voter permissions
14. Optimize API serialization groups
