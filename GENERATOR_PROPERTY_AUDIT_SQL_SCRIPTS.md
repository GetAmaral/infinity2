## Quick Verification

Run this query to get an instant overview of table quality:

```sql
SELECT
    'QUICK STATUS CHECK' as check_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE property_name IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(property_name) != '') as valid_names,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE property_type IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(property_type) != '') as valid_types,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE nullable IS NULL) as nullable_nulls,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE api_description IS NULL OR TRIM(api_description) = '') as missing_api_desc,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE api_example IS NULL OR TRIM(api_example) = '') as missing_api_example,
    ROUND(
        (
            COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE property_name IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(property_name) != '') +
            COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE property_type IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(property_type) != '') +
            COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE nullable IS NOT NULL) +
            COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE api_description IS NOT NULL) +
            COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE api_example IS NOT NULL)
        ) * 100.0 / (COUNT(*) * 5),
        2
    ) as quality_score_pct
FROM generator_property;
```

**Expected Result (100% quality):**
- total_rows: 1770
- valid_names: 1770
- valid_types: 1770
- nullable_nulls: 0
- missing_api_desc: 0
- missing_api_example: 0
- quality_score_pct: 100.00

## All Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: String Length (141 rows)

            PARTITION BY entity_id
            ORDER BY COALESCE(property_order, 0), property_name

## Automated Maintenance Queries

### Check for New Issues
Run this query periodically to detect any data quality issues:

```sql
WITH quality_checks AS (
    SELECT
        'property_name_empty' as check_name,
        COUNT(*) as issue_count
    FROM generator_property
    WHERE property_name IS NULL OR TRIM(property_name) = ''

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        'property_type_empty',
        COUNT(*)
    FROM generator_property
    WHERE property_type IS NULL OR TRIM(property_type) = ''

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        'property_order_invalid',
        COUNT(*)
    FROM generator_property
    WHERE property_order IS NULL OR property_order <= 0

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        'api_description_missing',
        COUNT(*)
    FROM generator_property
    WHERE api_description IS NULL OR TRIM(api_description) = ''

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        'api_example_missing',
        COUNT(*)
    FROM generator_property

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        'nullable_is_null',
        COUNT(*)
    FROM generator_property
    WHERE nullable IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        'relationship_without_target',
        COUNT(*)
    FROM generator_property
    WHERE relationship_type IS NOT NULL AND target_entity IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        'enum_without_class',
        COUNT(*)
    FROM generator_property
    WHERE is_enum = true AND enum_class IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        'indexed_without_type',
        COUNT(*)
    FROM generator_property
    WHERE indexed = true AND index_type IS NULL
)
SELECT
    check_name,
    issue_count,
    CASE
